# Moon-Server-Bot
Muneeb's Bot: an event based bot for the Moon Server

## About

daTXOGllama#1234 made a discord bot for Muneeb#0232

After about 1 and half years of the bot being broken (my bad) - it now works

You can access the bot by either going to discord.gg/wY8S3xJd7G or running the RunMoonBot.exe file (Some functionality has been removed)

Important ids and tokens have been hidden and replaced by a nonexistent variable id

## Antivirus

You may encounter issues with an antivirus program when running RunMoonBot.exe

Create an issue or message daTXOGllama#1234 (you will need to be in moon server) to ask for help fixing this issue

## Misc

Uses discord.py

Made for Moon Server discord.gg/wY8S3xJd7G

Only uses events
